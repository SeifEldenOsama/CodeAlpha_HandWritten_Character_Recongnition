I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten characters using the MNIST and EMNIST datasets. The model includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers with dropout for regularization, achieving high accuracy in digit and character classification. The workflow involved data preprocessing, model design, training, and performance evaluation using TensorFlow, Keras, and visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn. Evaluated the system using a confusion matrix, classification report, and prediction samples, demonstrating strong generalization for handwriting recognition.
